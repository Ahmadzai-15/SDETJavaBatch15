If we have to read the data from a file manually on our computers what do we need?
    1) We need to know where the file is stored on our computer
    2) we need to navigate to that folder
    3) A software that understands how the data is stored in those files.
To Create a new directory and "properties" file:
    1) Right-Click on your project name
    2) New->Directory(you can go with a package as well)->Enter the name.
    3) Right-click on your directory->new->File
    4) Give name to your file and an extension as .properties(config.properties)
